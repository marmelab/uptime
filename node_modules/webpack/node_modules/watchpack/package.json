Instead a three level architecture ensures that for each directory only a single watcher exists.\r\n\r\n* The high level API requests `DirectoryWatchers` from a `WatcherManager`, which ensures that only a single `DirectoryWatcher` per directory is created.\r\n* A user-faced `Watcher` can be obtained from a `DirectoryWatcher` and provides a filtered view on the `DirectoryWatcher`.\r\n* Reference-counting is used on the `DirectoryWatcher` and `Watcher` to decide when to close them.\r\n* The real watchers (currently chokidar) are created by the `DirectoryWatcher`.\r\n* Files are never watched directly. This should keep the watcher count low.\r\n* Watching can be started in the past. This way watching can start after file reading.\r\n* Symlinks are not followed, instead the symlink is watched.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nvar Watchpack = require(\"watchpack\");\r\n\r\nvar wp = new Watchpack({\r\n\t// options:\r\n\taggregateTimeout: 1000\r\n\t// fire \"aggregated\" event when after a change for 1000ms no additonal change occured\r\n\t// aggregated defaults to undefined, which doesn't fire an \"aggregated\" event\r\n\r\n\tpoll: true\r\n\t// poll: true - use polling with the default interval\r\n\t// poll: 10000 - use polling with an interval of 10s\r\n\t// poll defaults to undefined, which prefer native watching methods\r\n\t// Note: enable polling when watching on a network path\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Watchpack.prototype.watch(string[] files, string[] directories, [number startTime])\r\nwp.watch(listOfFiles, listOfDirectories, Date.now() - 10000);\r\n// starts watching these files and directories\r\n// calling this again will override the files and directories\r\n\r\nwp.on(\"change\", function(filePath, mtime) {\r\n\t// filePath: the changed file\r\n\t// mtime: last modified time for the changed file\r\n});\r\n\r\nwp.on(\"aggregated\", function(changes) {\r\n\t// changes: an array of all changed files\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Watchpack.prototype.pause()\r\nwp.pause();\r\n// stops emitting events, but keeps watchers open\r\n// next \"watch\" call can reuse the watchers\r\n\r\n// Watchpack.prototype.close()\r\nwp.close();\r\n// stops emitting events and closes all watchers\r\n\r\n// Watchpack.prototype.getTimes()\r\nvar fileTimes = wp.getTimes();\r\n// returns an object with all know change times for files\r\n// this include timestamps from files not directly watched\r\n// key: absolute path, value: timestamp as number\r\n```\r\n\r\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/webpack/watchpack/\r\n[coveralls-image]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/webpack/watchpack.svg\r\n",
